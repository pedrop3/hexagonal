<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project




This project demonstrates a Spring application built under the Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture. This approach aims for high cohesion and low coupling, promoting:

Separation of concerns: Business logic resides in the core of the application, isolated from external technologies and frameworks.
Improved testability: The focus on the core facilitates the creation of unit and integration tests, ensuring code reliability.
Robust maintainability: The modular architecture allows for easy modification and addition of functionalities without affecting the core code.
Flexibility: The application easily adapts to different technologies and frameworks, as the core remains independent.
Project Highlights:

Docker configurations: Automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application in Docker containers.
Postman collection for API testing: Facilitate the testing of the application's REST APIs with pre-configured Postman collections.
ArchUnit for Architecture Validation: Use ArchUnit to ensure that the application structure follows the principles of Hexagonal Architecture.
Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture:

Cleaner and more robust code: The separation of responsibilities makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
Easier testing: The modular architecture facilitates more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
Flexibility for change: The application easily adapts to new technologies and requirements.
Improved code reusability: Components can be easily reused in other applications.



### Built With

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Docker
- Postman (para testar as chamadas Ã  API)
- Mockoon (para simular a API externa)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* Java 17
* Maven 

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:pedrop3/hexagonal.git
   ```
2. Install dependencs
   ```sh
   mvn clean install compile
   ```
4. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can simply run the project by configuring the `launch.json`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
1. Run Docker Compose to start Kafka and MongoDB services:
   ```sh
    cd docker-local
    docker-compose up -d
   ```
## Testing API

1. **Import Postman Collection:**
   - Download the `Hexagonal.postman_collection.json`.
   - Open Postman.
   - Import the downloaded collection into Postman.

2. **Ensure Application is Running:**
   - Make sure the application is up and running.

3. **Test Endpoints:**
   - Use the endpoints provided in the Postman collection to test the functionality of the application.

## Simulating External API with Mockoon

1. **Install Mockoon:**
   - Install Mockoon from [here](https://mockoon.com/).

2. **Import Data:**
   - Download `addresses.json`.
   - Open Mockoon.
   - Import `addresses.json` into Mockoon to set up the simulation of the external API.

3. **Start Mockoon Server:**
   - Start the Mockoon server.

4. **Configure Application:**
   - Update the Spring application settings to make calls to the simulated API instead of the real API.

## Hexagonal Architecture Verification with ArchUnit

The project includes automated tests using ArchUnit to ensure that the hexagonal architecture is correctly followed. These tests are automatically executed during the compilation phase.
